Your wood bracket, corbel, rafter tail, will contain unique colors, grains, textures, knots, sapwood and heartwood content and possible sap bleeding and even natural checking, splitting and cracks. These natural variations are what make the Rustic Collection stand out from the rest. Be proud of your project; stand out from the cookie-cutter homes; use the Rustic Collection family of products.
 
Authentic detail and craftsmanship
Hand-crafted from the finest North American woods
Rough and smooth options available

Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high-density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions is achieved only by using our high-density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation. They are fully primed and ready for your paint. If you have any questions feel free to ask. These are in stock and available for immediate shipment.

Staining or retention of odors is unheard of. Clean up is simple. It measures 17 in. x 17 in. x 7 in. and is guaranteed to remain functional and engaging for life. The R9-7007-BN is a tall, vessel-style faucet soundly constructed of premium-quality, solid brass components. Its design is contemporary, but with a nostalgic, water pump spout design in a brushed nickel finish. Water temperature and pressure is controlled by the extended, swivel handle. Ceramic disc cartridges assure dependability. To stabilize this curved basin above the vanity, this brushed nickel sink ring is included. With a simple press to its handsome, brushed nickel dome; the included, spring-loaded, vessel pop-up drain can be opened or closed.

Lifetime Vinyl Custom Five Board Joined Board and Batten Shutters Pair Midnight Blue","Dress up your windows with our high quality Lifetime exterior vinyl shutters. The most rustic looking of popular exterior shutter styles, board and batten house shutters were the most common type of shutter in America until the mid-18th century, when lighter and open louver shutters became more common. Today they are most often used to bring back the charm of that era in our history and to match period-style architecture. These shutters are made of durable vinyl, one of today's most versatile exterior materials. With a rich wood grain molded into each pair, they are great alternatives to traditional wooden shutters, providing the look of wood, without the possible upkeep. They are lightweight, easy to maintain and resistant to water damage, warping and peeling. Our vinyl shutters are available in a full range of rich colors and are one of the best value products you will ever purchase for your home.

Carrie began painting in 2009 after developing a life-threatening allergy to heat. No longer able to spend time in her beloved garden, she began painting flowers instead of planting them. In 2010, she moved to the Seattle area to enjoy its temperate climate and now paints daily in her mountain studio surrounded by moss and towering evergreens.Giclee (jee-clay) is an advanced print making process for creating high quality fine art reproductions virtually indistinguishable from the original pieceSolid wood frame for durability and stabilityAvailable in multiple sizes to fit your decor needsPre-assembled for easy installationHang anywhere with the attached saw-tooth hangerGallery wrap is a method of stretching an artist's canvas around the sides of a hidden, wooden frame for a frameless presentation of the finished painting","N/A","N/A","N/A","USD","0.00","0.00","0.00","29.80","0.00","0.00%","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Product Depth (in.) : 2,

Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high-density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions is achieved only by using our high-density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. - Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. - Medallions are light weight for easy installation. - They are fully primed and ready for your paint.

Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high-density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions is achieved only by using our high-density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation. They are fully primed and ready for your paint. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. These are in stock and available for immediate shipment.

Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high-density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions is achieved only by using our high-density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation. They are fully primed and ready for your paint. If you have any questions feel free to ask. These are in stock and available for immediate shipment.

They are 2-3 times more affordable, all the while having beams that are indistinguishable from real wood.

Positive molding uses extreme pressure to compress the friction material and bond it to the backing plate. This process assures consistent friction material density throughout the pad, resulting in even wear and performance characteristics throughout the life of the brake pad. The number one cause for customer returns are noise and vibration. Centric Parts has recognized these issues and is constantly improving its products to eliminate these issues. Posi Quiet brake friction features either precision cut or shaved backing plates and mechanically attached shims; these small details ensure proper fitment in the caliper and virtually eliminate noise associated with pad vibration. In addition to these features Centric Parts has added a scorching process to all of its Posi Quiet brake pads. This additional process forces any impurities out of the friction material and pre-burnishes the pads to greatly accelerate the break-in process. All Posi Quiet brake pad friction formulations are asbestos free and are available in three application specific compounds complete with all necessary hardware for installation where applicable.
 
Longest wearing most advanced material available. 100% scorched for easy bed-in. 100% shimmed to eliminate noise and vibration. Stable friction performance across a wide temperature range. Hardware included. Where applicable

Our artisans then hand carve an original piece. Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high-density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions is achieved only by using our high-density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions.

Being hand carved each piece is richly detailed with deep relief, sharp lines and a truly unique touch. That master piece is then used to create a mould master. Once the mould master is created we use our high-density urethane foam to form each medallion. The finished look is a beautifully detailed, light weight, solid construction, focal piece. The resemblance to original plaster medallions is achieved only by using our high-density urethane and not vacuum formed, plastic type medallions. Medallions can be cut using standard woodworking tools to add a hole for electrical or a ceiling fan canopy. Medallions are light weight for easy installation. They are fully primed and ready for your paint. If you have any questions feel free to ask. These are in stock and available for immediate shipment.
